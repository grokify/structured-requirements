```

## Overview

This library provides comprehensive, machine-readable formats for planning documents:

### Requirements Documents

- **MRD** - Market Requirements Document: Market analysis, competitive landscape, buyer personas, positioning
- **PRD** - Product Requirements Document: Personas, user stories, functional/non-functional requirements, roadmap
- **TRD** - Technical Requirements Document: Architecture, technology stack, APIs, security design, deployment

### Goal Frameworks

- **OKR** - Objectives and Key Results: Objectives with measurable key results and phase targets
- **V2MOM** - Vision, Values, Methods, Obstacles, Measures: Salesforce-style goal alignment

### Roadmap

- **Roadmap** - Standalone roadmaps with phases, deliverables, and swimlane visualization
- **Journey Roadmap** - Capability maturity evolution planning with periods, targets, and narratives

### Prioritization Frameworks

Feature and requirement prioritization models (see [Feature Prioritization](#feature-prioritization) for usage and code):

| Framework | Type | Levels / Categories (highest → lowest) | Use Case |
|-----------|------|----------------------------------------|----------|
| **RICE** | Quantitative score | Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort · Impact: Massive, High, Medium, Low, Minimal | Data-driven feature ranking |
| **Kano** | Qualitative classification | Must-Be, Performance, Attractive, Indifferent, Reverse | Feature classification from customer surveys |
| **MoSCoW** | Release planning | Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, Won't Have | Scope negotiation and release planning |

### Investment Mix Frameworks

Portfolio dimensions in the `assessment` package classifying where product-development capacity is invested, resolved from evidence-backed judge answers like Kano and Market Investment Horizon:

| Framework | Source | Categories | Use Case |
|-----------|--------|------------|----------|
| **Run/Grow/Transform** | Gartner | Run, Grow, Transform | Executive IT investment roll-up by business outcome |
| **SRE Work Classification** | Google SRE | Software Engineering, Systems Engineering, Toil, Overhead | Engineering-efficiency lens; measure and reduce toil |
| **Product Development Investment Mix** | prism-roadmap | Innovate, Improve, Automate, Maintain, Toil | Expose toil and the Toil → Automate → Capacity Reclaimed loop |

**Product Development Investment Mix (PDIM)** synthesizes the other two and is the assessment grain. It classifies the mix of work *types* within the product portfolio (not an allocation across products); "product development" names the joint function — product management, engineering, design, docs — keeping the framework neutral between the product and engineering teams that present it together. Maintenance = non-toil maintenance + Toil, with Toil promoted to a first-class category while reducing it is an active objective (`PDIMRollup` collapses Toil into Maintain for the 4-bucket executive view). A PDIM classification deterministically projects onto both source frameworks — `PDIMToSREWork` definitionally (Toil → Toil, everything else → Engineering) and `PDIMToRGT` by documented convention (Innovate → Transform, Improve → Grow, Automate/Maintain/Toil → Run); an explicit RGT or SRE assignment takes precedence over the projection. `ToilReduction` quantifies the value an automation initiative captures from an identified toil source: hours reclaimed per month and payback period, treating automation as a capital-style investment.

### Strategic Planning Canvases

Visual canvas frameworks for strategic planning and opportunity assessment:

| Canvas | Framework | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **BMC** | Business Model Canvas (Osterwalder) | 9-block business model visualization |
| **OST** | Opportunity Solution Tree (Torres) | Tree structure for outcome-driven discovery |
| **Opportunity** | Opportunity Canvas (Patton) | 9-block opportunity assessment |
| **OpportunityAssessment** | SVPG Opportunity Assessment (Cagan) | 10-question go/no-go evaluation |
| **OpportunitySpec** | Merged Patton + Cagan | 12-box discovery + business case |
| **Feature** | Feature Canvas (Efimov) | Feature definition and validation |
| **Lean UX** | Lean UX Canvas (Gothelf) | Hypothesis-driven product design |

The **OpportunitySpec** is designed for feature-level opportunities, combining Patton's discovery rigor with Cagan's business case validation. It includes a canonical template and LLM evaluation rubric in `templates/` and `rubrics/`.

Each canvas supports multiple output formats:

- **D2** - D2 diagram language for high-quality diagrams
- **SVG** - Rendered vector graphics (native for BMC, OpportunitySpec, Opportunity Canvas, and Lean UX; others via D2 CLI)
- **Mermaid** - Mermaid diagram syntax for documentation
- **Lit/JSON** - Structured data for web components

### Opportunity Prioritization (Assessment IR)

The `assessment` package is an evidence-backed, rubric-driven prioritization record: a judge answers bounded Y/N rubric questions with cited evidence, and deterministic code — never the judge — resolves those answers into a MoSCoW tier, a RICE score, a portfolio classification, and a final rank. It reuses the `prioritization` package's `MoSCoWPriority`/`ImpactLevel`/`ConfidenceLevel` types rather than redefining them; the difference is the input path — resolved from cited evidence via a `Ladder` threshold classifier, instead of assigned directly.

> **Note:** `assessment.OpportunityAssessment` is unrelated to `canvas.OpportunityAssessment` (the SVPG canvas above) — different types in different packages that happen to share a name.

```go
import "github.com/grokify/prism-roadmap/assessment"

a := assessment.NewOpportunityAssessment("OA-018", ref, "Self-service SSO", time.Now())
a.MoSCoWAnswers = moscowAnswers // evidence-backed Ladder answers
a.RICE = &assessment.RICEAssessment{Reach: reach, ImpactAnswers: impactAnswers, ConfidenceAnswers: confidenceAnswers, Effort: effort}

tier := a.MoSCoW()                  // resolved via assessment.ResolveMoSCoWPriority
rank := assessment.DefaultRankingPolicy().Rank([]assessment.RankInput{a.ToRankInput()})
```

Portfolio dimensions (built-in Kano, Market Investment Horizon, Run/Grow/Transform, SRE Work Classification, and Product Development Investment Mix, or a custom `DimensionDefinition`), OKR contribution links, and `prism-capability` references attach to the same assessment but are descriptive only — never a `RankingPolicy` input. A `ReportDataset` compiled across an assessment corpus feeds a per-opportunity six-pager (`OpportunityReport`) and a whole-portfolio review (`PortfolioReview`), both pure functions of the dataset. See the [Opportunity Prioritization guide](https://grokify.github.io/prism-roadmap/assessment/overview/) for the full pipeline.

**COMPASS-RICE** ([`compass-rice`](https://github.com/ProductBuildersHQ/compass-rice)) replaces the single-scale ladder RICE above when a portfolio mixes opportunity types whose raw metrics aren't comparable (a customer feature vs. a platform investment vs. a risk mitigation): six investment-thesis profiles each normalize their own domain-specific evidence into the same canonical, cross-profile-comparable score.

```go
score := assessment.ResolveCompassRICE(a.Compass) // same RICEScoreResult shape as ComputeRICE

proposed := assessment.ProposeProfileAssignment("OS-042", "customer/b2b/v1", "primarily a retention play", "judge-session-9")
confirmed := proposed.Confirm("pm@example.com", time.Now()) // two-phase: LLM proposes, PM confirms
```

`ToRankInput` prefers `a.Compass` over `a.RICE` when both are present. See the [COMPASS-RICE section](https://grokify.github.io/prism-roadmap/assessment/overview/#compass-rice-cross-profile-comparable-rice) of the same guide.

### Journey Roadmaps

Plan capability maturity evolution over time with the `journey` package:

```go
import "github.com/grokify/prism-roadmap/journey"

roadmap := journey.JourneyRoadmap{
    ID:      "security-2026",
    Name:    "Security Capability Roadmap 2026",
    Periods: []journey.Period{
        {ID: "q1-2026", Name: "Q1 2026", StartDate: "2026-01-01", EndDate: "2026-03-31"},
        {ID: "q2-2026", Name: "Q2 2026", StartDate: "2026-04-01", EndDate: "2026-06-30"},
    },
    Capabilities: []journey.CapabilityJourney{
        {
            ID:           "sast",
            Name:         "Static Analysis",
            CurrentLevel: 2,
            TargetLevel:  4,
            Targets: []journey.CapabilityMaturityTarget{
                {PeriodID: "q1-2026", Level: 3, Confidence: "high"},
                {PeriodID: "q2-2026", Level: 4, Confidence: "medium"},
            },
        },
    },
}
```

Key types:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `JourneyRoadmap` | Root type with periods, capabilities, dependencies, teams |
| `CapabilityJourney` | Tracks capability maturity progression |
| `CapabilityMaturityTarget` | Target level for a period with confidence |
| `Dependency` | Cross-capability or external dependencies |
| `Team` | Team hierarchy with capacity assignments |
| `Initiative` | Work items driving capability improvements |
| `JourneyNarrative` | Executive storytelling with chapters |

### Feature Prioritization

Prioritization frameworks integrated with OpportunitySpec:

| Framework | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| **RICE** | Quantitative | Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort |
| **Kano** | Qualitative | Categories: Must-Be, Performance, Attractive, Indifferent, Reverse |
| **MoSCoW** | Release Planning | Categories: Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, Won't Have |

On `rmi.RoadmapItem`, MoSCoW is **optional** (v0.17.0+): empty means "not
yet prioritized" — the natural state for items imported from an external
PM tool (e.g. via [omniroadmap](https://github.com/grokify/omniroadmap),
which converts Aha!/ProductBoard/JPD data into RoadmapItems) before
triage. When set, it must be a valid priority;
`prioritization.MoSCoWUnspecified` names the zero value.

```go
import "github.com/grokify/prism-roadmap/prioritization"

// RICE scoring
rice := prioritization.NewRICEScore("feature-1", 1000, ImpactHigh, ConfidenceHigh, 2.0)
rice.Calculate() // Score = 1000

// Kano classification
category := prioritization.ClassifyKano(KanoLike, KanoDislike) // Performance

// MoSCoW prioritization
priority := prioritization.MoSCoWMustHave
weight := priority.Weight() // Returns 4
```

RICE-scored roadmap items can be linked to OKR objectives to show how much
prioritized effort is backing each goal:

```go
import (
    "github.com/grokify/prism-roadmap/rmi"
    "github.com/grokify/prism-roadmap/goals/okr"
)

item := rmi.NewRoadmapItem("RMI-1", "Onboarding revamp", prioritization.MoSCoWMustHave).
    WithRICE(prioritization.NewRICEScore("RMI-1", 1000, prioritization.ImpactHigh, prioritization.ConfidenceHigh, 2.0))
item.AddObjectiveRef("OBJ-activation") // link to an OKR objective

// Roll up RICE scores per objective (ordered by total RICE, highest first)
rollups := rmi.RICEByObjective([]rmi.RoadmapItem{*item}, doc.Objectives)
for _, r := range rollups {
    fmt.Printf("%s: total RICE %.0f across %d scored items\n", r.ObjectiveTitle, r.TotalRICE, r.ScoredCount)
}

// Surface prioritized work not tied to any objective
orphans := rmi.UnlinkedScoredItems(items)
```

### Market Signals & Effort Estimation

Aggregate customer demand and estimate implementation effort:

```go
import (
    "github.com/grokify/prism-roadmap/signal"
    "github.com/grokify/prism-roadmap/effort"
    "github.com/grokify/prism-roadmap/rmi"
)

// Market signal from customer ideas
sig := &signal.MarketSignal{
    TotalVotes:    150,
    CustomerCount: 25,
    TotalARR:      500000000, // $5M in cents
}
sig.CalculateScore() // Weighted score

// Effort estimation with complexity
est := &effort.EffortEstimate{
    PersonDays: 15,
    TShirtSize: effort.TShirtSizeMedium,
    Confidence: effort.ConfidenceMedium,
}

// Complexity factors
complexity := &effort.ComplexityFactors{
    NewArchitecture: false,
    NewDesignUX:     true,
    Dependencies:    []effort.Dependency{{Name: "Auth API", Type: "internal"}},
}

// Roadmap Item combining all components
item := &rmi.RoadmapItem{
    ID:           "rmi-feature-1",
    Name:         "Bulk Export",
    MoSCoW:       prioritization.MoSCoWShouldHave,
    MarketSignal: sig,
    Effort:       est,
    Complexity:   complexity,
    Status:       rmi.RMIStatusApproved,
}
```

The natural workflow from market to implementation:

**MRD** (Market) → **PRD** (Product) → **TRD** (Technical)

Each document type supports:

- Mandatory and optional sections for flexibility
- JSON serialization with Go types (camelCase field names)
- Markdown generation with Pandoc-compatible YAML frontmatter
- Validation of required fields
- Framework-agnostic goals (OKR or V2MOM)

```

### Section Ordering (PRD only)

Control the order of sections in generated markdown:

```bash
# Use a PRD type template for section ordering
splan req prd generate input.json --type=strategy   # Context-first (CurrentState, Problem, Market early)
splan req prd generate input.json --type=feature    # User-needs-first (Problem, Personas, UserStories early)
splan req prd generate input.json --type=technical  # Architecture-focused (TechArchitecture early)

# Custom section order (comma-separated IDs)
splan req prd generate input.json --order=executiveSummary,problem,solution,objectives

# List available section IDs
splan req prd list-sections
```

### Check Options (PRD only)

```bash
splan req prd check input.json          # Human-readable completeness report
splan req prd check input.json --json   # JSON output for programmatic use
```

### Examples

## Library Usage

### Requirements Documents

```go
package main

import (
    "encoding/json"
    "os"

    "github.com/grokify/prism-roadmap/requirements/prd"
    "github.com/grokify/prism-roadmap/requirements/mrd"
    "github.com/grokify/prism-roadmap/requirements/trd"
)

func main() {
    // Create a PRD programmatically
    doc := prd.Document{
        Metadata: prd.Metadata{
            ID:      "prd-001",
            Title:   "User Authentication System",
            Version: "1.0.0",
            Status:  prd.StatusDraft,
            Authors: []prd.Person{{Name: "Jane Doe"}},
        },
        ExecutiveSummary: prd.ExecutiveSummary{
            ProblemStatement: "Users need secure authentication",
            ProposedSolution: "Implement OAuth 2.0 with MFA",
        },
        // ... additional fields
    }

    // Generate markdown
    opts := prd.MarkdownOptions{
        IncludeFrontmatter: true,
        Margin:             "2cm",
    }
    markdown := doc.ToMarkdown(opts)

    // Or marshal to JSON
    data, _ := json.MarshalIndent(doc, "", "  ")
    os.WriteFile("output.prd.json", data, 0600)
}
```

### Goals (OKR and V2MOM)

The `goals` package provides a framework-agnostic interface for both OKR and V2MOM:

```go
import (
    "github.com/grokify/prism-roadmap/goals"
    "github.com/grokify/prism-roadmap/goals/okr"
    "github.com/grokify/prism-roadmap/goals/v2mom"
)

// Create OKR-based goals
okrSet := okr.OKRSet{
    Objectives: []okr.Objective{
        {
            ID:          "obj-1",
            Description: "Increase customer satisfaction",
            KeyResults: []okr.KeyResult{
                {ID: "kr-1", Description: "NPS score", Target: "> 50"},
            },
        },
    },
}
g := goals.NewOKR(okrSet)

// Or create V2MOM-based goals
v := v2mom.V2MOM{
    Vision: "Be the market leader",
    Methods: []v2mom.Method{
        {ID: "m-1", Description: "Launch enterprise features"},
    },
}
g := goals.NewV2MOM(v)

// Framework-agnostic access
for _, item := range g.GoalItems() {
    fmt.Println(item.Description())  // Works with both OKR and V2MOM
}

// Dynamic labels based on framework
fmt.Println(g.GoalLabel())   // "Objectives" (OKR) or "Methods" (V2MOM)
fmt.Println(g.ResultLabel()) // "Key Results" (OKR) or "Measures" (V2MOM)
```

### PRD with Goals

PRDs support framework-agnostic goals via the `ProductGoals` field:

```go
import (
    "github.com/grokify/prism-roadmap/requirements/prd"
    "github.com/grokify/prism-roadmap/goals"
)

doc := prd.Document{
    // ... metadata, executive summary, etc.
    ProductGoals: goals.NewOKR(okrSet),  // or goals.NewV2MOM(v2mom)
}

// Roadmap tables use correct terminology automatically
table := doc.ToSwimlaneTableWithGoals(opts)  // Uses "Objectives" or "Methods"
```

### Strategic Planning Canvases

```go
import (
    "github.com/grokify/prism-roadmap/canvas"
    "github.com/grokify/prism-roadmap/canvas/render"
    "github.com/grokify/prism-roadmap/canvas/render/d2"
)

// Create an Opportunity Solution Tree
ost := canvas.NewOpportunitySolutionTree("ost-1", "User Onboarding")
ost.Outcome = canvas.OSTOutcome{
    ID:          "O1",
    Description: "Increase activation to 60%",
    Opportunities: []canvas.OSTOpportunity{
        {
            ID:          "OP1",
            Description: "Users don't understand value prop",
            Solutions: []canvas.OSTSolution{
                {ID: "S1", Description: "Interactive tutorial"},
            },
        },
    },
}

// Wrap and render to D2
c := canvas.NewOST(ost)
d2Output, _ := render.Render(c, render.FormatD2, render.OSTOptions())

// Create an Opportunity Canvas with grid layout (BMC-style)
opp := canvas.NewOpportunityCanvas("opp-1", "Mobile App")
opp.Users = []canvas.User{{ID: "u1", Name: "Mobile Users"}}
opp.Problems = []canvas.Problem{{ID: "p1", Description: "Desktop-only access"}}
opp.SolutionIdeas = []string{"Native app", "PWA"}

// Render as grid (no arrows) or flow (with arrows)
gridD2, _ := render.Render(canvas.NewOpportunity(opp), render.FormatD2, render.OpportunityGridOptions())
flowD2, _ := render.Render(canvas.NewOpportunity(opp), render.FormatD2, render.OpportunityOptions())
```

See `examples/canvas/` for complete examples with rendered D2, SVG, Mermaid, and HTML outputs.

## Evaluation Integration

The library integrates with `structured-evaluation` for standardized quality reports:

```go
import "github.com/grokify/prism-roadmap/requirements/prd"

// Load and score a PRD
doc, _ := prd.Load("my-product.prd.json")

// Convert deterministic scoring to Rubric format
report := prd.ScoreToRubric(doc, "my-product.prd.json")

// Or generate a template for LLM judge evaluation
template := prd.GenerateEvaluationTemplate(doc, "my-product.prd.json")

// Validate the generated report (v0.7.0+)
result := rubric.ValidateReport(report)
if !result.Valid {
    // Handle validation errors
}
```

**Standard Evaluation Categories:**

| Category | Weight | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| problem_definition | 20% | Problem statement clarity and evidence |
| solution_fit | 15% | Solution alignment with problem |
| user_understanding | 10% | Persona depth and user insights |
| market_awareness | 10% | Competitive analysis |
| scope_discipline | 10% | Clear objectives and boundaries |
| requirements_quality | 10% | Functional and non-functional specs |
| metrics_quality | 10% | Success metrics with targets |
| ux_coverage | 5% | Design and accessibility |
| technical_feasibility | 5% | Architecture and integrations |
| risk_management | 5% | Risk identification and mitigation |

### Roadmap and Swimlane Table

The PRD roadmap is rendered as a swimlane table with phases as columns and deliverable types as rows.

#### Roadmap Structure

```json
{
  "roadmap": {
    "phases": [
      {
        "id": "phase-1",
        "name": "MVP",
        "deliverables": [
          {
            "id": "d1",
            "title": "User Authentication",
            "type": "feature",
            "status": "completed"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### Ensuring Items Appear in the Roadmap Table

For a deliverable to appear in the swimlane table:

1. **Add to a Phase**: The deliverable must be in a phase's `deliverables` array
2. **Set the Type**: The `type` field determines which swimlane row the item appears in
3. **Set Status (optional)**: The `status` field adds a status icon

#### Deliverable Types (Swimlanes)

| Type Value | Swimlane Row | Description |
|------------|--------------|-------------|
| `feature` | Features | Product features and capabilities |
| `integration` | Integrations | Third-party integrations |
| `infrastructure` | Infrastructure | Platform, CI/CD, monitoring |
| `documentation` | Documentation | User guides, API docs |
| `milestone` | Milestones | Release milestones, checkpoints |
| `rollout` | Rollout | Customer/segment deployment phases |

#### Deliverable Status Icons

| Status Value | Icon | Description |
|--------------|------|-------------|
| `completed` | ✅ | Work is done |
| `in_progress` | 🔄 | Currently being worked on |
| `not_started` | ⏳ | Planned but not started |
| `blocked` | 🚫 | Blocked by dependency |

#### Example: Complete Deliverable

```json
{
  "id": "auth-feature",
  "title": "OAuth 2.0 Authentication",
  "description": "Implement OAuth 2.0 with support for Google and GitHub providers",
  "type": "feature",
  "status": "in_progress"
}
```

This appears in the **Features** row under the phase it belongs to, with a 🔄 icon.

#### Common Issues

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Item not appearing | Missing or invalid `type` | Set `type` to a valid value |
| Item in wrong row | Wrong `type` value | Check spelling (e.g., `feature` not `Feature`) |
| Item in wrong column | Wrong phase | Move deliverable to correct phase's array |
| No status icon | Missing `status` field | Add `status` field with valid value |

#### Operational Rollout Swimlane

The `rollout` type enables tracking customer/segment deployments across phases. This is useful for phased go-to-market strategies where features are deployed to different customer segments over time.

**Recommended approach for calendar-tied phases:**

When phases represent calendar periods (quarters, months), place rollouts in the phase when deployment actually occurs, not when development completes:

| Swimlane | **Phase 1**<br>Q1 2026 | **Phase 2**<br>Q2 2026 | **Phase 3**<br>Q3 2026 |
|----------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| **Features** | • Auth<br>• Dashboard | • Reporting<br>• API v2 | • Analytics |
| **Rollout** | | • ✅ Auth → Enterprise<br>• 🔄 Dashboard → Pilot | • Reporting → All |

**Rationale:**

- **Reflects reality** - Development and rollout rarely happen in the same calendar window
- **Shows dependencies** - Clearly communicates "build first, then deploy"
- **Planning accuracy** - Resource allocation aligns with actual work timing

**Naming convention for rollout deliverables:**

Use the `→` notation to distinguish rollout targets:

```json
{
  "id": "rollout-auth-enterprise",
  "title": "Auth → Enterprise customers",
  "description": "Roll out Phase 1 Auth feature to enterprise segment",
  "type": "rollout",
  "status": "completed"
}
```

**Example: Multi-phase customer rollout**

```json
{
  "phases": [
    {
      "id": "phase-1",
      "name": "Q1 2026 - Build",
      "deliverables": [
        { "id": "f1", "title": "User Authentication", "type": "feature", "status": "completed" },
        { "id": "f2", "title": "Dashboard", "type": "feature", "status": "completed" }
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "phase-2",
      "name": "Q2 2026 - Pilot",
      "deliverables": [
        { "id": "f3", "title": "Reporting", "type": "feature", "status": "in_progress" },
        { "id": "r1", "title": "Auth → Enterprise (Acme, TechCo)", "type": "rollout", "status": "completed" },
        { "id": "r2", "title": "Dashboard → Pilot customers", "type": "rollout", "status": "in_progress" }
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "phase-3",
      "name": "Q3 2026 - GA",
      "deliverables": [
        { "id": "r3", "title": "Auth → All customers", "type": "rollout", "status": "not_started" },
        { "id": "r4", "title": "Dashboard → All customers", "type": "rollout", "status": "not_started" },
        { "id": "r5", "title": "Reporting → Enterprise", "type": "rollout", "status": "not_started" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## PDF Generation

The generated markdown includes YAML frontmatter compatible with Pandoc.

```bash
# Generate markdown
splan req prd generate myproduct.prd.json -o myproduct.md

# Convert to PDF
pandoc myproduct.md -o myproduct.pdf
```

**Requirements:**

- [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/installing.html)
- A LaTeX distribution (TeX Live, MacTeX, or MiKTeX)

### Handling Status Icons (Emoji)

The default output uses emoji status icons (✅, 🔄, ⏳, etc.) which display correctly in HTML but may not render in PDF output. You have two options:

**Option 1: Use text icons for PDF compatibility**

```go
opts := prd.DefaultMarkdownOptions()
opts.UseTextIcons = true  // Uses [DONE], [WIP], [TODO] instead of emoji
markdown := doc.ToMarkdown(opts)
```

Text icon mappings:

| Emoji | Text Icon |
|-------|-----------|
| ✅ | [DONE] |
| 🔄 | [WIP] |
| ⏳ | [TODO] |
| 🚫 | [BLOCKED] |
| ❌ | [MISSED] |

**Option 2: Use XeLaTeX with emoji-capable fonts**

```bash
pandoc myproduct.md -o myproduct.pdf --pdf-engine=xelatex \
  -V mainfont="Noto Sans" \
  -V monofont="Noto Sans Mono"
```

Note: This requires fonts with emoji support (e.g., Noto Color Emoji, Apple Color Emoji).

## Templates and Rubrics

The `templates/` and `rubrics/` directories contain canonical assets for LLM-assisted document authoring and evaluation. Each asset has a Markdown template (`templates/<name>.md`) and, where evaluation applies, a matching LLM-as-a-Judge rubric (`rubrics/<name>.rubric.yaml`) in [structured-evaluation](https://github.com/plexusone/structured-evaluation) rich format.

### Continuous Discovery (Torres)

| Asset | Template | Rubric | Description |
|-------|:--------:|:------:|-------------|
| Discovery Snapshot | ✅ | ✅ | Weekly discovery progress snapshot |
| Assumption Map | ✅ | ✅ | Desirability/viability/feasibility/usability risk mapping |
| Experience Map | ✅ | ✅ | Customer journey across phases surfacing pain points and opportunities |
| Opportunity Solution Tree | ✅ | ✅ | Outcome → opportunities → solutions → experiments |
| OpportunitySpec | ✅ | ✅ | Merged Patton + Cagan 12-box discovery + business case |

### Strategy & Business Model

| Asset | Template | Rubric | Description |
|-------|:--------:|:------:|-------------|
| Business Model Canvas | ✅ | ✅ | Osterwalder 9-block business model |

### Shape Up (Basecamp)

| Asset | Template | Rubric | Description |
|-------|:--------:|:------:|-------------|
| ShapeUp Pitch | ✅ | ✅ | Problem framing and appetite setting |
| ShapeUp Scope | ✅ | — | Scope hammering during build |

### V2MOM (Salesforce)

The full V2MOM set — one asset per section plus the reconciled summary — each with a template and rubric:

| Asset | Template | Rubric | Description |
|-------|:--------:|:------:|-------------|
| Vision | ✅ | ✅ | Compelling future state |
| Values | ✅ | ✅ | Ranked guiding principles |
| Methods | ✅ | ✅ | Initiatives that advance the vision |
| Obstacles | ✅ | ✅ | Blockers and mitigations |
| Measures | ✅ | ✅ | Quantifiable success metrics |
| Alignment | ✅ | ✅ | Cascade alignment to a parent V2MOM |
| Summary | ✅ | ✅ | Reconciled rollup of all five sections |

These assets are designed for integration with [multispec](https://github.com/plexusone/multispec) for structured document workflows, and are consumed downstream via `tools/prism-sync`.

## Examples

See the `examples/` directory for complete examples:

- `examples/agent-platform.mrd.json` - Market requirements for an AI governance platform
- `examples/agent-control-plane.prd.json` - Product requirements for the control plane
- `examples/agent-control-plane.trd.json` - Technical requirements for implementation

## TypeScript / JavaScript

For TypeScript/JavaScript projects, use the unified `@grokify/prism` npm package:

```bash
npm install @grokify/prism
```

```typescript
import { JourneyRoadmapSchema } from '@grokify/prism/schema/roadmap';
import { renderTimelineView } from '@grokify/prism/html/roadmap';

// Validate data
const roadmap = JourneyRoadmapSchema.parse(jsonData);

// Render to HTML
const html = renderTimelineView(roadmap);
```

See [@grokify/prism on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@grokify/prism) for full documentation.
