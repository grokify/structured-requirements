// OpportunityReport is the per-opportunity 6-pager's renderer-ready input:

// list with per-section presence and narrative slots. Assembled by

// OpportunityRank; the actual markdown/text render is a pure function of
// this struct — the LLM narrative pass fills NarrativeSlot.Text values, it
// does not decide section presence or invent facts (prism-roadmap PRD:
// "the report is always a pure function of the IR").
//
// Unlike ReportDataset (the portfolio-wide compile output,
// RMI-PRISMROADMAP-010), an OpportunityReport is scoped to a single
// opportunity — it is the "audit this one ranking end-to-end" artifact
// (prism-roadmap PRD success criteria: "a contested ranking can be
// defended end-to-end: rank → framework classifications → rubric answers →
// evidence records → source links").
